# Parser Combinators, following LLJS' Video Series

This parser combinator library is inspired by ArcSecond and the LLJS Video Series on Parser Combinators. This implementation is in Rust, and as such follows its idioms which differ from JavaScript's. 
This project may go in a different direction than the one followed by LLJS's Video Series in the future.
